<p>
When running an algorithm live, there are two ways of placing an order
using the method <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#">MarketOrder</a>: asynchronous or synchronous.
</p>

<h3> Asynchronous market order</h3>
<p>
This type of market order is sent to a broker without waiting for a market order fill
response from the broker.
</p>
<p>
Asynchronous order is typically used when many market orders are sent to a
broker at once as there might be a delay in response from the broker as a result.
</p>
<p>
A delayed response from broker does not result in termination of an algorithm 
as opposed to sending synchronous market order.
</p>
<h3> Synchronous market order</h3>
<p>
This type of market order is sent to a broker while waiting for an order fill response from
the broker. Delayed fill response that exceeds specified maximum time, which is by default 5 seconds,
will result in termination of an algorithm.
